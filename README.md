**Daily:** Continue Vim + LeetCode + Backend work

### Phase 3: Advanced + Frontend (Weeks 9-12)
**Focus:** Concurrency + Real-time + Next.js
- Go goroutines and channels mastery
- Real-time features (WebSocket in both Go and Django)
- Next.js frontend basics
- System Design learning
- Complete 1 advanced project

**Daily:** LeetCode + Advanced topics + Project work

### Phase 4: Production Project (Weeks 13-16)
**Focus:** Build portfolio-worthy project
- **Choose:** Go backend OR Django backend (or both!)
- Next.js frontend
- Real-time features (WebSocket or SSE)
- PostgreSQL + Redis + Background jobs
- Comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)
- Docker Compose setup
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

## 🗓️ Weekly Focus

### Go + Vim Priority Schedule

- **Monday:** Go Programming + Vim Practice
- **Tuesday:** Go APIs + Advanced Django (not basics!)
- **Wednesday:** Multi-Language LeetCode Deep Dive
- **Thursday:** Databases (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ)
- **Friday:** Infrastructure (Docker, Linux, CI/CD)

## 💻 LeetCode Practice (100+ Problems)

### 315 Curated Problems
- **File:** `leetcode/LEETCODE-ROADMAP.md`
- **Organized by:** 14 topics (Arrays, Trees, DP, Graphs, etc.)
- **Each problem has:** Difficulty, companies, priority rating
- **Your approach:** Solve each problem in Go, Python, and TypeScript

### Create Problem Files:
```bash
./scripts/leetcode/new_problem_multilang.sh
```

This creates 4 files:
- `problem.go` (Go solution)

## 🚨 Important Notes

### For Mid-Level Django Developers (You):
- **Skip Django basics** - You already know this
- **Focus on:** `weekly-schedule/ADVANCED.md` for senior-level Django topics
- **Projects:** Build from `projects/django/ADVANCED-PROJECTS.md` (no simple CRUD)
- **Schedule:** Use Go + Vim priority version

### Daily Non-Negotiables:
1. **Vim practice** (30 min) - Only way to learn
2. **LeetCode** (90 min) - In 3 languages, every single day
3. **Progress tracking** (15 min) - Document what you learned

### Success Principles:
1. **Consistency > Intensity** - Show up every day
2. **Build, don't tutorial** - Real projects, not guided lessons
3. **Test everything** - No feature without tests
4. **Depth > Breadth** - Master backend thoroughly
5. **Production mindset** - Always ask "Would this work in production?"
