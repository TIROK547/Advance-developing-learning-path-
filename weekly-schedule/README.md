## How to Use

### Starting a New Week

1. **Copy the template:**
   ```bash
   cp weekly-schedule/templates/WEEK-TEMPLATE.md weekly-schedule/week-01.md
   ```

2. **Fill in the header:**
   - Week number
   - Date range
   - Weekly focus/goal
   - Current phase

3. **Track daily:**
   - Check off completed items
   - Document learnings
   - Note challenges
   - Update LeetCode progress

4. **End of week:**
   - Complete weekly summary
   - Update progress tracker
   - Reflect and adjust

### Tracking Overall Progress

Update `progress-tracking/PROGRESS-TRACKER.md` weekly:
- Mark completed phases
- Update skill levels
- Track LeetCode count
- Log weekly stats
- Note milestones

## Schedule Overview

### Phase-Based Learning (16 weeks)

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Foundation**
- Django + DRF + PostgreSQL + Testing
- Goal: Master backend fundamentals

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Async & Infrastructure**
- Celery + Redis + RabbitMQ + Docker + Linux
- Goal: Production-ready backend skills

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Real-time & Frontend**
- WebSocket/SSE + Next.js + System Design
- Goal: Full-stack integration

**Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16): Production Project**
- Build portfolio-worthy project
- Goal: Demonstrate all skills

## Time Commitment

**Daily:** 6-8 hours (full-time learning)
**Weekly:** 44-60 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Backend: 50-60%
- Infrastructure: 20-25%
- Frontend: 15-20%
- System Design: 5-10%

## Key Principles

1. **Consistency > Intensity** - Show up daily
2. **Build > Tutorial** - Real projects, not courses
3. **Test Everything** - No feature without tests
4. **Document Daily** - Notes are your future reference
5. **Deploy for Real** - Localhost doesn't count

## Adjusting the Plan

**Moving too slow?**
- Focus on critical path (Django → PostgreSQL → Celery → Docker)
- Reduce frontend time
- Skip Terraform temporarily

**Moving too fast?**
- Add Go learning
- Deep dive system design
- Build multiple projects
- Contribute to open source

**Feeling stuck?**
- Review fundamentals
- Ask for help
- Take a break
- Simplify and iterate

## Success Metrics (End of 16 weeks)

- ✅ 100+ LeetCode problems
- ✅ Deep Django/DRF knowledge
- ✅ Production-grade project deployed
- ✅ System design understanding
- ✅ Docker/Linux/CI/CD comfortable
- ✅ Portfolio ready
- ✅ Interview confident

**Remember:** This is your roadmap, not a prison. Adjust as needed, but stay consistent.
